# 🛠️ TaskForge — CI/CD + Cloud DevOps Showcase Project

**TaskForge** is a hands-on DevOps project designed to simulate a real-world CI/CD delivery pipeline for modern web applications.  
This project is designed to demonstrate my ability to build, containerize, test, deploy, and scale applications end-to-end using real DevOps and cloud tools used in production today.

Inspired by enterprise DevOps workflows, TaskForge highlights:
- Building a backend API using **FastAPI**
- Creating a frontend using **React + TypeScript**
- Managing persistent data with **Postgres on Neon**
- Containerization with **Docker**
- CI/CD automation using **Jenkins**
- Image publishing to **AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**
- Deployment to **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**
- Auto-scaling and self-healing using **Kubernetes primitives**

TaskForge is built incrementally so every commit reflects a real phase of the DevOps lifecycle from application development to full production-grade deployment.
